# About

A VueJS based website modeled after [X-Team.com](https://x-team.com)

# Goals

1. Practice Vue skills
2. Practice modular design (Everything is a component)
3. Implement SSR
4. Have something to show

# Progress

I decided to stop halfway through. (I did #1 and #2).

## What I learned

Side stepping the technical aspect, there are two things that stood out:

- Modular design has a cost: It's about trading short-term productivity for the long-term one. It _feels_ better as you _just get started_ and have immediate (visual) feedback but when the product could be decomposed to lots components then it makes more sense to modularize. The trick is figuring out what to decompose and to what extent.
- The tooling is lacking, it might not seem so but the actual coding experience is different from what's advertised. This is coming from someone who uses typescript and has used angular.

## Why I stopped

I decided to switch to React. While I enjoyed the overall developer experience with Vue, it has -- in my view -- 3 issues:

1. **Market share**: On GitHub it's the most popular of the 3, not in the market.
2. **Backing**: At first I thought that this was an advantage; No big company backing you means no constraints/politicking. What I realized is that when a big co backs you, it has a vested interest.
3. **Versatility**: I'd like to get into app development and stay on the same stack (if possible). React seems to be the only one doing it well.
